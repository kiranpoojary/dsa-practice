# TREES

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is =a tree data structure in computer science where each node has a maximum of two children, called the left child and the right child.

### Properties Of BT

1. Root
2. Child
3. Siblings
4. Ancestors
5. Leaf nodes

### Types of BT

#### 1. Full Binary Tree:

    Each not either have 0 child or 2 children

#### 2. Complete BT

- all levels are completely filled except last level
- last level can have left node only

#### 3. Perfect BT

all leaf node should be in same level

#### 4. Bananced BT

Hight can be Max of logN(n=No. Nodes)

#### 5. Degenerate Tree

every node has single child(one sided)

### BT Travesal Techniques

#### 1. DFS(Depth First Search)

##### i. In-Order Traversal

Left->Root->Right

##### ii. Pre-Order Traversal

Root->Left->Right

##### iii. Post-Order Traversal

Left_>Right->Root


#### 2. BFS(Breadth First Search)

level wise search
